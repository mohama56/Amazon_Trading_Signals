Stock Trading Signals Analysis ðŸ“ˆ
A Python-based project that identifies buy/sell signals using RSI and MACD.

Project Overview
This project analyzes stock price data to identify potential trading opportunities using technical indicators and quantitative analysis techniques.

Key Features
RSI (Relative Strength Index):
Calculates overbought and oversold conditions to identify momentum changes.

MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence):
Identifies trends using short-term and long-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and generates signals for potential buy/sell opportunities.

Technologies Used
Python
Libraries:
pandas â†’ Data analysis and manipulation
numpy â†’ Numerical computations
matplotlib â†’ Data visualization
seaborn â†’ Statistical visualizations


Example Usage
Below is a sample of the stock data used in the project:

Date	Close	Open	High	Low	Volume	% Change
12/11/14	149.4	148.2	149.8	148.5	68.87M	1.29%
12/12/14	150.1	150.5	150.8	150.2	62.00M	-0.27%
Sample Plot:

RSI to identify momentum changes.
MACD crossovers for buy/sell signals.
Project Applications
Quantitative Trading Strategies: Using technical indicators to time trades.
Analyzing Stock Trends and Momentum: Visualizing trends for data-driven insights.
Risk Management: Identifying overbought or oversold conditions to reduce trading risks.
Future Improvements
Add additional technical indicators like Bollinger Bands or Moving Averages.
Automate live data fetching using APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance).
Implement backtesting strategies using historical data for performance evaluation.
